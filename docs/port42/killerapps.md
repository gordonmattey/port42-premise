Problems everyone has at 11 PM

Time saved is obvious

3 hours → 30 seconds
Not incremental, revolutionary
Worth way more than $49

The Launch Strategy
Week 1: Build YOUR solution - solve your actual problems
Week 2: Record yourself using it for real work
Week 3: Post the raw video - "I built this because I was drowning"
Week 4: Watch every founder say "HOLY SHIT I NEED THIS"
You're not building a nice tool. You're building the thing that saves founders from drowning in their own success.
That's the demo. That's the product. That's the revolution.
Ready to build the thing that solves YOUR problems? Because if it saves your sanity, it'll save everyone's.
